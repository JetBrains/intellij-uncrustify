uncrustify.settings.config.explanation=There are three possibilities when the plugin selects an Uncrustify configuration file to be used for formatting:\n\
1. File named `uncrustify.cfg` in project folder.\n\
2. If `uncrustify.cfg` cannot be found in the project folder, custom file specified in `Settings | Tools | Uncrustify` is used.\n\
3. If neither `uncrustify.cfg` nor custom file are specified, a temporary configuration file is generated from most suitable IntelliJ code style settings.
